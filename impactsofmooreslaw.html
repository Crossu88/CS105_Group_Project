					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power (also referred to as performance) and cost are two key drivers of technological development. As more transistors fit into smaller spaces, processing power increases and energy efficiency improves, all at a lower 
					costs for the end user. This development not only enhanced existing industries and increased productivity, but it has acted as the spawn of entirely new industries; all of which, are empowered by cheap and powerful computing.

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore’s observation transformed computing. A once rare, elite, and expensive venture was now a ubiquitous, accessable, and affordable necessity. All of the modern computing technology we know, and enjoy, sprang from the foundation 
					laid by Moore’s Law. From the Internet itself, to social media and modern data analytics. All these innovations' derivations can be traced back directly to Moore, and his findings.

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inexpensive, prevalent computing found rapidly expanding all around us is fundamentally changing the way we work, play, and communicate. The foundational force of Moore’s Law has driven breakthroughs in modern 
					cities, transportation, healthcare, education, and energy production. In fact, it’s quite difficult to envision what our modern world might be like without Moore’s Law. Moore's Law, framed by Intel co-founder 
					Gordon Moore, continues to have a significant impact on the electronics sector as the fundamental principle that guides the course of modern computing and the semiconductor industry. One of the economic 
					impacts of the law is that computing devices continue to show exponential growth in complexity and computing power, while achieving comparable reductions in cost to the manufacturer, and the consumer. Interdisciplinary bodies, such as the Materials Research Society, continue to feature improvements and innovations in the process of chemical mechanical planarization (an abrasive cleaning technique used in 
					manufacturing integrated circuits to optimize the cost and efficiency of a chip). Consequently, the lowered cost of manufacturing paired alongside the increased reliability of new technology nodes, has resulted in 
					significant improvement in the equity and operating profits of the semiconductor industry and, ergo, the electronics sector.
					<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marketing has accelerated. The cost of “launch and see” is now higher than the cost of the tools and time needed to test campaigns during development. The opportunity costs of websites, ads, and email campaigns--that return mediocre results--are far too excessive. With inexpensive behavioral tools, we can now launch campaigns with confidence. Big companies use big data to gain an advantage, and yet the quality of the data provided does not 
					determine or translate to the success of one's business anymore. It is the quality of the questions asked--because answers to the majority of questions one may have with behavioral science driven by Moore’s Law are available.
