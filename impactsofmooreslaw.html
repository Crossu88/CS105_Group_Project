					Performance—aka power—and cost are two key drivers of technological development. As more transistors fit into smaller spaces, processing power increased and energy efficiency improved, all at a lower 
					cost for the end user. This development not only enhanced existing industries and increased productivity, but it has spawned whole new industries empowered by cheap and powerful computing.

					Moore’s observation transformed computing from a rare and expensive venture into a pervasive and affordable necessity. All of the modern computing technology we know and enjoy sprang from the foundation 
					laid by Moore’s Law. From the Internet itself, to social media and modern data analytics, all these innovations stem directly from Moore and his findings.

					The inexpensive, ubiquitous computing rapidly expanding all around us is fundamentally changing the way we work, play and communicate. The foundational force of Moore’s Law has driven breakthroughs in modern 
					cities, transportation, healthcare, education, and energy production. In fact, it’s quite difficult to envision what our modern world might be like without Moore’s Law. Moore's Law, framed by Intel co-founder 
					Gordon Moore, continues to have a significant impact on the electronics sector as the fundamental principle that guides the course of modern computing and the semiconductor industry. One of the economic 
					impacts of the law is that computing devices continue to show exponential growth in complexity and computing power while effecting a comparable reduction in cost to the manufacturer and the consumer. 
					Interdisciplinary bodies such as the Materials Research Society continue to feature improvements and innovations in the process of chemical mechanical planarization, an abrasive cleaning technique used in 
					manufacturing integrated circuits that optimizes the cost and efficiency of the chip. Consequently, the lowered cost of manufacturing and the increased reliability of new technology nodes has resulted in 
					significant improvement in the equity and operating profits of the semiconductor industry and, as a result, the electronics sector.
					<br><br>
					Marketing has accelerated. The cost of “launch and see” is now higher than the cost of the tools and time needed to test campaigns during development. The opportunity cost of websites, ads and email campaigns 
					that return mediocre results is too high. With inexpensive behavioral tools, we can now launch campaigns with confidence. Big companies use big data to gain an advantage. Yet the quality of your data doesn’t 
					determine the success of your business anymore. It is the quality of your questions — because we can now answer almost any question you have with behavioral science driven by Moore’s Law.
