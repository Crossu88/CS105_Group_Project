			<h2><center>The End of Moore's Law</center></h2>

					“There’s a law about Moore’s law,” jokes Peter Lee, a vice-president at Microsoft Research: “The number of people predicting the death of Moore’s law doubles every two years.” But now the computer industry 
					is increasingly aware that the jig will soon be up. while the benefits of making things smaller have been decreasing, the costs have been rising. This is in large part because the components are approaching 
					a fundamental limit of smallness: the atom. A Skylake transistor is around 100 atoms across, and the fewer atoms you have, the harder it becomes to store and manipulate electronic 1s and 0s. More radically, 
					some hope to redefine the computer itself. One idea is to harness quantum mechanics to perform certain calculations much faster than any classical computer could ever hope to do. Another is to emulate 
					biological brains, which perform impressive feats using very little energy. Yet another is to diffuse computer power rather than concentrating it, spreading the ability to calculate and communicate across an 
					ever greater range of everyday objects in the nascent internet of things. The next logical step, says Mr Snir of Argonne National Laboratory, is “gate-all-around” transistors, in which the channel is 
					surrounded by its gate on all four sides. That offers maximum control, but it adds extra steps to the manufacturing process, since the gate must now be built in multiple sections. As you may know, extreme 
					ultraviolet (EUV) has been waiting in the wings for years now, never quite reaching full readiness due to its extremely high power usage and some resolution concerns. In the mean time, chip makers have fallen 
					back on increasing levels of multiple patterning—multiple lithographic exposures, which increase manufacturing time (and costs).
					<br><br>
					Now, however, directed self-assembly (DSA)—where the patterns assemble themselves—is also getting very close to readiness. If either technology wants to be used over multiple patterning for 7nm logic, the 
					ITRS says they will need to prove their readiness in the next few months.
					<br><br>
					for computing to continue to improve at the rate to which everyone has become accustomed, something more radical will be needed. One idea is to try to keep Moore’s law going by moving it into the third 
					dimension. Modern chips are essentially flat, but researchers are toying with chips that stack their components on top of each other. Even if the footprint of such chips stops shrinking, building up would 
					allow their designers to keep cramming in more components, just as tower blocks can house more people in a given area than low-rise houses. Quantum computing proposes to use the counterintuitive rules of 
					quantum mechanics to build machines that can solve certain types of mathematical problem far more quickly than any conventional computer, no matter how fast or high-tech (for many other problems, though, a 
					quantum machine would offer no advantage). Their most famous application is cracking some cryptographic codes, but their most important use may be accurately simulating the quantum subtleties of chemistry, a 
					problem that has thousands of uses in manufacturing and industry but that conventional machines find almost completely intractable. A Canadian firm called D-Wave already sells a limited quantum computer, 
					which can perform just one mathematical function, though it is not yet clear whether that specific machine is really faster than a non-quantum model. The ability to remove the hardware that does the 
					computational heavy lifting from the hunk of plastic with which users actually interact – known as “cloud computing” – will be one of the most important ways for the industry to blunt the impact of the 
					demise of Moore’s law. Unlike a smartphone or a PC, which can only grow so large, data centres can be made more powerful simply by building them bigger. As the world’s demand for computing continues to 
					expand, an increasing proportion of it will take place in shadowy warehouses hundreds of miles from the users who are being served.
