				      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  For a special issue of the journal Electronics, Moore was asked to predict developments over the next decade. Observing that the total number of components in these circuits had roughly doubled each year, 
					he blithely extrapolated this annual doubling to the next decade, estimating that microcircuits of 1975 would contain an astounding 65,000 components per chip.
					There's an anecdote about personal computers that has existed almost as long as the devices themselves have been on the market. It goes as follows: You buy a new computer, take it home and just as you finish unpacking it you see an 
					advertisement for a new computer that makes yours obsolete. 
                    <br> <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scientists, electrical engineers, manufacturers, and journalists extrapolated Moore's Law from his original observation. In general, most people 
					interpret Moore's Law to mean that the number of transistors on a 1-inch (2.5 centimeter) diameter of silicon, doubles every x-number of months. 
					<br> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore's Law implies a quadrupling of computing power due to the combination of more, and faster, transistors. Even so, the number of transistors devoted to performing logic operations has not grown exponentially 
					during the last several years. Cache memories have indeed increased in size, but this has resulted in only modest performance increases. So as a result, computer system power now appears to be doubling every three 
					years, even though integrated circuit (IC) transistor density is still doubling every two years. If IC transistor density doubles every four years, then that will lead to processor performance possibly doubling every 5-6 years. This may be true unless computer designers find 
					a better (more effective and more efficient) way to use transistors than the alternative of simply increasing cache size, and also finding a better way to improve performance than simply increasing clock speeds. These restrictions will prove to ultimately make innovations in the increase of computer speeds, more challenging.
